## Executive Summary

This project presents an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of customer churn patterns in the telecommunications industry using Tableau. The dashboard visually explores the key drivers behind customer churn, focusing on **contract type**, **tenure**, and **monthly charges** to uncover actionable insights for reducing churn and increasing customer retention.

**Goal:** Understand what factors most strongly influence churn and recommend data-driven strategies to reduce it.

---

## Key Business Questions

* Are **new or long-term customers** more likely to churn?
* How does **contract length** affect churn rate?
* Is churn more common among customers with **higher monthly charges**?
* What pricing and contract strategies could reduce churn?

---

## Key Insights

* **Tenure & Churn:**
  Customers with **0–3 years of tenure** have the highest churn rate. Retention strategies should focus on **newer clients** who are most at risk of leaving.

* **Contract Type & Churn:**
  **Month-to-month customers churn significantly more** than those with one-year or two-year contracts.

  >  **Recommendation:**<br/>
       - Encourage customers to commit to **longer-term contracts** to stabilize retention.

*  **Monthly Charges & Churn:**
  A large share of churn comes from customers with **higher monthly charges**.

   >  **Recommendation:**<br/>
        - Offer **lower introductory pricing** to attract new customers.<br/>
        - Gradually **increase rates over time** for longer-tenured clients, who are less likely to churn and more likely to perceive value.
